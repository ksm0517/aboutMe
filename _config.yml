  주어진 미션을 완료해내는 프로그래머 <mark>김성민입니다.</mark>.<br/>
  취미로 일렉기타🎸를 칩니다. 특기는 영상 편집🎬입니다.🎥<br/>
  대학교 때 응원단장, 과대표❤️‍🔥 등을 맡아 팀원들과 소통, 성과물을 만드는 것의 즐거움을 배웠습니다.<br/>
  비전공자로써 CS지식이 부족한 점을 채우고자 틈틈히 운영체제, 자료구조, 알고리즘 등에 대해 공부하고 있습니다.✍️<br/>
  좋은 인연을 만나 좋은 성과를 만들고 싶습니다.😃

          I found when model become deeper, it makes high mAP<br/>
          I thought it might not helpful for me to experimenting just bigger model.<br/>
          So I focused on finding trouble in visualized picture.<br/>
          And tried fix them by changing function of model like rpn proposal, fpn.

  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      **anormaly detection, mlops** 등에 관심을 가지고 있으며, AI 연구 환경 구축에 흥미를 느낍니다.<br/>
      **잘 몰라서 해매는 것을 두려워 하지 않으며**, 저보다 잘 아는 분에게 배우는 것에 즐거움을 느낍니다.<br/>
      프로젝트를 수행한 것은 아니여서 잘은 모르지만 JSP 기반 backend를 공부한 적이 있습니다.<br/>
      이 때, CSS, html, sql 등의 웹에 대해 조금은 익혔습니다.<br/>
      아직은 잘 모르는 것들이 많지만 꾸준히 성장해나가는 주니어 개발자가 되고 싶습니다.
