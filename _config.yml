          I tried to see change when augmentation is applied.<br/>
          I think this was the reason that we could go high when private set was revealed.<br/>
          And I tried to make many engineering tool.

          I found when model become deeper, it makes high mAP<br/>
          I thought it might not helpful for me to experimenting just bigger model.<br/>
          So I focused on finding trouble in visualized picture.<br/>
          And tried fix them by changing function of model like rpn proposal, fpn.
