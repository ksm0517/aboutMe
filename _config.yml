          I found when model become deeper, it makes high mIoU
          I thought it might not helpful for me.
          so I focus on finding trouble in visualized picture
          and tried change model to fix them

          contribute : build lib environment, ensemble, augmentation, crf tool etc.<br/>
          When object detection project, I didn't have time to research augmentation.
          And there is no much things to fix model
          So I tried to see change when augmentation is applied

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
